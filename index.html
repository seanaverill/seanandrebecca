            <p class="modal-p">One Tuesday, Sean asked Becca if she wanted to go up to Portsmouth to her favorite soup
                place, The
                Soupery, to get lunch that weekend. Immediately Becca texted her best friends saying Sean asked to get
                soup, and that he was going to propose. As good friends do, they gently told her that maybe soup doesn’t
                mean a proposal. When Becca came home that day from work she told Sean what she texted her friends, and
                Sean frantically spent the following days convincing Becca that she was crazy and that he was not going
                to propose. The morning of their soup date, Becca said to Sean “if you’re really not going to propose
                today I’m going to wear sweats” Sean lied right to her face and said he was not going to propose and she
                can wear whatever she wants. Luckily, Becca decided to change and wore leggings instead. After soup,
                Sean and Becca decided to go up to Fort Foster, where they had one of their first dates. Becca decided
                she needed to use the bathroom, so they stopped at a Walgreens on the way. After Becca came back to the
                car, Sean decided to use the bathroom as well, and as he opened the car door the woman in the car next
                to us got out of the car as well, and slipped on the leaves while trying to step up onto the curb. She
                immediately toppled over and hit her head and starting yelling for help. Sean went over to save the day,
                and we ended up calling an ambulance. Sean’s sister, Julia, was waiting for us to arrive at Fort Foster
                and was very concerned that we were going to miss our perfect sunset proposal. Luckily, the paramedics
                came and took away our new friend, Carol, in a very timely manner, and we arrived to Fort Foster just as
                the sun was setting. It was so windy and cold that theo didn’t even want to explore! “Spontaneously” we
                decided to walk down the pier for a pretty view of the water. About half way down Becca decided it was
                too cold and suggested turning back to the car. Sean was very convincing in his ‘let’s walk down to the
                end of the pier’ argument, so we walked down. At the end of the pier Sean got down on one knee, and of
                course Becca thought he was kidding… until she saw the box, immediately burst into tears, and could only
                mutter the words “yes” and “are you serious?!” Then Julia revealed herself, took some pictures, and we
                drove home to find both our families waiting for us at home, and we all went out to a nice dinner. </p>

                        <p>
                            After meeting on Hinge and talking for several weeks Becca finally agreed to go on a date
                            with Sean, or as Becca tells it Sean finally got the courage to ask her out. Becca was
                            living in Maine at the time while Sean was in Massachusetts so they met in the middle at
                            Captain's Cove in Hampton, New Hampshire to play some minigolf before getting dinner at
                            Galley Hatch and talking until the restaurant closed.

                            Becca and Sean moved into an apartment in Medford, Massachusetts. After going back and forth
                            from Sean’s apartment to Becca’s throughout part of the beginning pandemic, it already felt
                            as if we had been living together for some time. The apartment was perfectly located between
                            Becca and Sean’s offices, and just a train ride away from many close friends!

                        <p>
                            After months of searching Becca found Juanita, a breeder in Kansas City who had a puppy that
                            was everything we were looking for. He was smaller than a can of soup and had the smushiest
                            face. Becca and Sean facetimed with the puppy and fell in love. Flights were booked
                            immediately and just a month later returned home with the smallest, cutest, puppy in all the
                            land. Theo quickly learned that the world revolved around him, and he continues to have the
                            same mindset today. We are thrilled to say that he will have the role as ‘Best Pup’ in the
                            wedding!

                            After a year of living together, and a few months of having Theo, we realized we needed more
                            space for Theo to run and play, so we starting searching for a house. We quickly found a
                            house we loved and knew was meant to be ours. Before we knew it we had become residents of
                            Melrose, Massachusetts.

                            Sean took Becca on a date to The Soupery and Fort Foster, where we had one of our first
                            dates. On the way we made a pit stop, and at the same time Sean was getting out of the car
                            the woman in the adjacent car got out, slipped, fell over, and whacked her head. Sean jumped
                            into action and called an ambulance for our new friend, Carol. After she was safely on the
                            way to the hospital we went to Fort Foster where we walked out on the pier and Sean proposed
                            to Becca, while she was crying tears of joy.
